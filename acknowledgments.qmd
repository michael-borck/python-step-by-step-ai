## A Note on AI Collaboration

This book represents a unique collaboration between human expertise and artificial intelligence. In keeping with the book's central philosophy of "Learning with AI," the book itself was created using AI as a collaborative partner.

### How This Book Was Written

- **Human Direction**: All conceptual frameworks, pedagogical approaches, and learning objectives were designed by Michael Borck
- **AI Assistance**: Claude (Anthropic) assisted with:
  - Drafting and refining explanations
  - Generating code examples and exercises
  - Ensuring consistency across chapters
  - Developing practice problems and solutions

### Transparency and Learning

Just as this book teaches you to work effectively with AI as a learning partner, it was created using the same principles. Every chapter, example, and exercise has been:

- Carefully reviewed and validated by human expertise
- Tested for pedagogical effectiveness
- Refined through iterative human-AI collaboration

This transparent approach to AI collaboration serves as a meta-example of the book's core message: AI is a powerful tool that, when used thoughtfully with human oversight, can enhance our ability to create, learn, and teach.

### Traditional Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:
- The Python community for creating such an accessible and powerful language
- The educators and researchers exploring AI in education
- Early readers and reviewers who provided valuable feedback
- You, the reader, for embracing this new approach to learning programming

*"In the spirit of the book's philosophy, this acknowledgment itself was written collaboratively with AI, demonstrating that transparency about AI use enhances rather than diminishes the value of human-AI collaboration."*

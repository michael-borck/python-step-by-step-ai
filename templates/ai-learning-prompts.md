# AI Learning Prompt Templates

These templates evolve as students progress through the book. Students should always include what they know so far.

## Chapter 1: First Steps

```
I'm a complete beginner learning Python. I only know:
- How to use print() to display text

[Your question here]

Please explain using ONLY print() statements.
```

## Chapter 2: Variables

```
I'm a beginner learning Python. I only know:
- How to use print() to display text
- How to create and use variables

[Your question here]

Please explain using ONLY these concepts.
```

## Chapter 3: Input

```
I'm a beginner learning Python. I only know:
- How to use print() to display text
- How to create and use variables
- How to use input() to get user responses

[Your question here]

Please explain using ONLY these concepts.
```

## Chapter 4: Conditionals

```
I'm learning Python step by step. So far I know:
- print() for displaying text
- Variables for storing values
- input() for getting user input
- if/else statements for decisions

[Your question here]

Please explain using ONLY these concepts. No loops, no functions, no lists.
```

## Chapter 5: Loops

```
I'm learning Python step by step. So far I know:
- print(), variables, input()
- if/elif/else statements
- while loops
- for loops with range()

[Your question here]

Please explain using ONLY these concepts. No functions, no lists, no imports.
```

## Debugging Template (All Chapters)

```
I'm learning Python and my code has an error. Here's what I know so far:
[List your known concepts]

Here's my code:
[Paste your code]

Here's the error:
[Paste the error message]

Can you explain what's wrong using only concepts I know?
```

## Simplification Template (All Chapters)

```
I'm a Python beginner. I only know these concepts:
[List your known concepts]

Please simplify this code to use ONLY what I know:
[Paste complex code]

Remove any advanced features and make it as simple as possible.
```

## Good vs Bad Prompts

### ❌ Bad: Too Open-Ended
"Write a calculator program in Python"

### ✅ Good: Specific and Limited
"I'm learning Python and only know print() and variables. Can you show me how to display a calculation result?"

### ❌ Bad: Asking for Advanced Features
"How do I make a GUI calculator?"

### ✅ Good: Working Within Constraints
"Using only print(), variables, and input(), how can I make a program that adds two numbers?"

### ❌ Bad: Copy-Paste Request
"Give me the code for [project]"

### ✅ Good: Understanding Request
"I wrote this code [paste code] for [project]. I don't understand why [specific line] is needed. Can you explain?"

## Evolution Pattern

Notice how the prompts grow:
1. Start with single concept constraints
2. Add new concepts explicitly
3. Always list what you DON'T know yet
4. Be specific about limitations

## Tips for Students

1. **Always include your knowledge list** - This prevents AI from using advanced features
2. **Ask for explanations, not just code** - Understanding is the goal
3. **Request step-by-step breakdowns** - Don't accept mysterious solutions
4. **Challenge complex responses** - Ask "Can this be simpler?"
5. **Use AI to check understanding** - "Is my explanation of [concept] correct?"

## Warning Signs You're Misusing AI

- You're copying code without reading it
- You can't explain what the code does
- You're using features not yet covered
- You're asking AI to do homework for you
- You're not trying to solve it yourself first

## The Ultimate Test

If you can't recreate the solution from memory after understanding it, you're not learning—you're just copying.

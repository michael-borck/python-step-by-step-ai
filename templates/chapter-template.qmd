# [Chapter Title]: [Concept Name] {#sec-[chapter-slug]}

[Opening paragraph that connects to the student's current experience and explains why this concept matters in the age of AI.]

## Your First Reality Check

Before we start, let's try something. Open your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever you're using) and type this prompt:

```
[AI prompt that will generate overly complex code]
```

The AI might give you something like this:

```python
# [Complex AI-generated code example]
# This will be much more complicated than necessary
```

[Analysis of what the AI created and why it's overwhelming for beginners]

Now try to change it. [Specific modification request]. Not sure where to start? That's the problem. The AI gave you a Ferrari, but you need to learn to walk first.

## The Simplest [Concept]

Let's start over. The simplest way to [do the core task] is:

```python
# Simple, clear example
# One concept at a time
```

That's it. [Brief statement about simplicity]. When you run this code, Python [explains what happens]:

```
[Expected output]
```

Let's understand every single character:

### [Component 1]

```python
# Code with annotation arrows
#    ^
#    explanation
```

[Detailed explanation of component 1]

### [Component 2]

[Continue pattern for each component]

## Common AI Overcomplication #1

Ask AI to "[common request]" and it might give you:

```python
# Overly complex AI version
```

But all you really need is:

```python
# Simple version
```

## The Simplification Game

Let's play a game with your AI. Copy this prompt exactly:

```
I'm a complete beginner learning [concept]. 
Here's what I know so far: [list from previous chapters]
Please simplify this code to use ONLY what I know:

[paste complex code here]
```

Keep asking it to simplify until the code makes sense to you.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: [Specific mistake]

```python
# Wrong way
```

**Error message:**
```
[Actual Python error]
```

**Fix:**
```python
# Right way
```

### Mistake 2: [Another mistake]

[Continue pattern]

## Your Learning Prompt

When you're stuck, use this template with your AI:

```
I'm learning [concept] in Python.
I understand: [what you know]
I'm confused about: [specific question]
Can you explain using ONLY these concepts: [list]
```

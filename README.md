# Python Step by Step: Learning with AI

📚 An innovative programming textbook that embraces AI as a learning partner. Master Python by learning how to think computationally and direct AI to help you build solutions.

## 🎯 Overview

This book represents a fundamental shift in how we teach programming in the age of AI. Instead of treating AI as something to avoid, we embrace it as a powerful learning partner. Students learn to think computationally, design solutions, and direct AI to help implement their ideas.

### Key Philosophy: "You're the Architect, AI is Your Assistant"

- **Concept First**: Understand patterns before syntax
- **AI as Explorer**: Use AI to discover and understand
- **Mental Models**: Build deep understanding, not just working code
- **Progressive Partnership**: Evolve from AI explaining concepts to AI implementing your designs

- Access to an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Python installed on your computer
- Enthusiasm to learn!

### Building the Book

This book is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). To build locally:

```bash
# Install Quarto first (see https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-step-by-step-ai.git
cd python-step-by-step-ai

# Preview with live reload
quarto preview

# Build all formats
quarto render

# Build specific format
quarto render --to html
quarto render --to pdf
quarto render --to epub
```

### Output Formats
- 📱 HTML (interactive web version with dark mode)
- 📄 PDF (professional typography for printing)
- 📖 EPUB (optimized for e-readers)

## 🎓 For Educators

This book is designed for a 12-week introductory programming course. Each week includes:
- Conceptual learning with AI exploration
- Hands-on exercises with 5-level progression
- Weekly projects that reinforce concepts
- Reflection and journaling prompts

### The 5-Level Exercise System
1. **Concept Recognition** - Identify patterns without coding
2. **Prompt Engineering** - Learn to communicate with AI effectively
3. **Pattern Matching** - Find concepts in complex code
4. **Model Building** - Create mental models and visualizations
5. **Architect First** - Design solutions before implementation

### Teaching Approach
- **Weeks 1-4**: AI as Concept Explorer
- **Weeks 5-8**: AI as Implementation Assistant
- **Weeks 9-12**: AI as Code Producer (following student designs)

fortunes = [

    "Your persistence will lead to success.",
    "An exciting opportunity awaits around the corner.",

Learning Notes:
- We import random at the top to use its functions
- The fortune list contains 7 different string messages
- random.choice() randomly selects one item from the list
- We use print() with empty parentheses for blank lines
- String concatenation (+) combines text with our fortune
- Emojis make the output more engaging

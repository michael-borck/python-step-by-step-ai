This solution adds lucky numbers and fortune categories.

# Create different categories of fortunes
love_fortunes = [
    "Love is in the air! Keep your heart open.",
    "A meaningful connection will deepen soon.",
    "Someone appreciates you more than you know."
]

career_fortunes = [
    "Your hard work is about to pay off big time!",
    "A new opportunity will present itself this month.",
    "Your skills will be recognized and rewarded."
]

general_fortunes = [
    "Adventure awaits those who seek it!",
    "A mystery will be solved in unexpected ways.",
    "Your positive energy attracts good things."
]

# Combine all fortunes for random selection
all_fortunes = love_fortunes + career_fortunes + general_fortunes

# Add lucky numbers

"""
Intermediate Concepts Used:
- Multiple lists that get combined with +
- More elaborate formatting with "="*50
- Using end="" in print to keep output on same line
- Creating a list of lucky numbers with a loop
- Using .join() to display numbers nicely
- Added fortune teller personality

Week 2 Project: Mad Libs Generator
Student Name: ________________
Date: _______________________

This program creates an interactive Mad Libs story by collecting
words from the user and inserting them into a story template.
"""

# TODO: Print a welcome message for your Mad Libs game
# Make it fun and explain what's about to happen!




# TODO: Collect at least 8 different words from the user
# Use descriptive variable names and clear prompts
# Example: adjective1 = input("Enter an adjective: ")

# Nouns (at least 2)



# Verbs (at least 2)



# Adjectives (at least 2)



# Other word types (at least 2)
# Ideas: color, place, animal, food, number, name, etc.




# TODO: Create your story using the collected words
# You can use concatenation (+) or f-strings if you've learned them
# Make sure your story is funny and uses ALL the words!

print("\nHere's your Mad Libs story:\n")

# TODO: Print your story title
# Example: print("The Amazing Adventure")
print("=" * 30)  # This creates a line of equals signs



# TODO: Print your complete story
# Break it into multiple lines for readability
# Make sure to include all the words the user entered!




# TODO: Print a closing message thanking the user



# Optional enhancements:
# - Add more word inputs for a longer story
# - Create multiple story templates
# - Add ASCII art or emojis
# - Validate that users don't leave inputs empty

# TODO: Print welcome message and game instructions




# TODO: Generate a random number between 1 and 100
# Hint: use random.randint(1, 100)



# TODO: Initialize variables
# You'll need:
# - A variable to track if the game is won (boolean)
# - A variable to count guesses



# TODO: Create the main game loop
# This should continue until the player guesses correctly

    # TODO: Get the player's guess
    # Remember to convert the input to an integer!
    
    
    # TODO: Increment the guess counter
    
    
    # TODO: Check the guess and provide feedback
    # Use if/elif/else to check:
    # - If guess equals the secret number (they won!)
    # - If guess is too high
    # - If guess is too low
    


# TODO: After the loop ends, print a congratulations message
# Include how many guesses it took



# TODO: Print a closing message



# Optional enhancements:
# - Add input validation (what if they type letters?)
# - Limit the number of guesses allowed
# - Ask if they want to play again
# - Add difficulty levels
# - Give better hints ("way too high" vs "a little high")

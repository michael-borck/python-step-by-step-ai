# Task List: Python Step by Step: Learning with AI

## Project Overview
Creating a comprehensive educational book for complete beginners learning Python programming with AI assistance. The book follows a unique pedagogical approach where AI serves as a "patient tutor, not a ghostwriter."

## REVISION NOTE: Book Structure Updated for "Learning with AI" Philosophy
The book has been restructured to embrace AI as a learning partner rather than something to avoid. Each chapter now starts with concepts, uses AI for exploration, and builds mental models before code.

## Notes

### Priority Considerations
- High priority: Core chapters (Parts 0-I), exercise system, and AI integration
- Medium priority: Later chapters (Parts II-III), formatting, and review
- Low priority: Supplementary materials and distribution

### Dependencies
- Chapter 0 must be completed first as it establishes the learning philosophy
- Exercise templates should be created early to ensure consistency
- AI prompt templates should evolve alongside chapter development

### Quality Standards
- Every code example must be tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- All exercises must follow the 5-level progression system
- Each chapter must include reality check, simplification, and reflection
- AI interactions must demonstrate both good and bad practices

### Timeline Estimates
- Setup and infrastructure: 1 week
- Part 0: 1 week
- Part I (4 chapters + projects): 4 weeks
- Part II (4 chapters + projects): 4 weeks
- Part III (4 chapters + projects): 4 weeks
- Part IV and wrap-up: 1 week
- Exercise repository and solutions: 2 weeks
- Review and polish: 2 weeks
- Total estimated time: 19 weeks
